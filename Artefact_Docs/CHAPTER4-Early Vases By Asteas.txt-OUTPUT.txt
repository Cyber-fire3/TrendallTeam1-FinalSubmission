Gabriella Prisco, A.I.O.N. 7, 1985, p. 139, no. 4, fig. 43, 1.
(a) Eros with cista and fillet, (a) youth.
The vase is known to m e only from the illustration of the obverse in Prisco's article; she
associates it with other vases from the workshop of Asteas and Python, and the Eros is very
similar in treatment, especially in regard to the wings, to the one on no. 98; the ground-lines
and dividing palmettes also correspond. The lid was found with a bowl (inv. 38129) but,
according to Prisco, the two do not belong together.
