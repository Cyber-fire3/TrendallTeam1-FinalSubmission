PP-13-*642 - THE SPINAZZO GROUP *642 Paestum 27091, from Spinazzo (1972), T. 86. Ht. 26, diam. 35/24-5. PLATE266c,d

(a) Toilet scene—two nude women kneeling in front of a basin—open box and folded

The folded drapery above the two women on (a) connects the minor vases in section 4
with those in this division.
5E.g. nos. 647, 649-50, 662; see PP-s, p. 163 and PAdd, p. 24. For parallels in Apulian cf. RVAp II,
pis. 185,4; 203,4; 312,8; 314,2; there, however, it is generally sat upon, rather than hung up, as on
most of the Paestan vases.

PP-13-644 - THE SPINAZZO GROUP 644 Paestum 27088, from Spinazzo (1972), T. 86. Ht. 9, diam. 12/7.
(a) and [b) Female head.
Also by this painter is another vase from the same tomb:

Lebes gamikos
PP-13-*645 - THE SPINAZZO GROUP *645 Paestum 27092, from Spinazzo (1972), T. 86. Ht. 41. Lid missing. PLATE 227 c, d
(a) Toilet scene—two nude women at a laver; above, Eros with fan flying to 1., (o) draped
woman running to r., with bunch of grapes in r. hand and patera in 1.
This, too, shows a laver scene, but here the two nude women are standing, one
on each side of the laver, above which flies a rather plump little Eros, holding up a
fan; on either side of it is the typical piece of folded drapery with the open box in the
top left-hand corner above. The reverse takes us back to the running women on the
vases in the Group of Paestum 5188—again the Apulian background is very clear,
not only in the pose and drapery of the woman, but also in the long-haired patera
she holds in one hand, and the black-dotted bunch of grapes in the other.
Slightly later works, but containing the stock figures from the preceding vases,
are the two following badly battered lebetes gamikoi:

PP-13-647A - THE SPINAZZO GROUP 647A Another fragment, from the Basilica [PAdd, no. A 345), shows women at their toilet, with
folded drapery above, and is close in style to the preceding fragment, if not from the same
vase.
The two following vases, which come from the same tomb as no. 643, represent,
like that vase, a slightly later phase in the painter's work.

The skyphoid pyxis is a vase of some stylistic interest and, unlike some of the
others, especially those in (ii), is comparatively well preserved. The scene on the
obverse is adapted from that on the lebes gamikos 27092 (no. 645) and shows the
same two women, just a shade fatter, by the laver with the two pieces of folded
