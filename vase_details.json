The vase has the form of a lekanis, with figured decoration around the lid and a frontal white female head on the knob. Internally it is divided into four compartments, around a central well, and each compartment is fitted with a lid decorated in red-figure, with two small perforated holes at the top. A comparable r.f. vase is B.M. F 139 [CVA 2, IV Ea, pi. 4,11; LCS, p. 211, no. 64 and Suppl. Ill, p. 105, no. 105, where it is attributed to the Revel Painter), and another, in the Gnathia technique, is B.M. F 502 [CVA 1, IV Dc, pi. 8,15-16), although the former lacks a covering lid, and the latter individual lids to the four compartments. A n earlier example of a Paestan vase divided internally into compartments, each with a figured lid, will be found in the remarkable hydria at present on the London market (no. 2/85; PI. 37); a somewhat later lepaste (no. 165), also in the Geddes collection, is divided internally into four compartments, like the present vase, which m a y well have served as its model, although there are no individual lids for the compartments. Lid: Young satyr in front of seated draped woman, young silen capering by nude w o m an (white flesh), approached from behind by a young silen, with a nude boy bending down behind him, standing draped woman, nude w o m a n at laver beside which is a swan. Knob: Frontal female head, with face in added white, now largely worn off. Interior: (i) w o m a n seated on dotted rock, veined palmette leaf to r.; (ii) nude youth bending forward in front of altar; (iii) as for (i) with leaf to 1.; (iv) as for (ii) though the youth is here not so close to the altar.",

Neck: (a) female head, [b) palmette. In PP, and PPSupp, this vase was attributed to the Painter of Naples 2585, but the drawing of the woman's face, the rendering of her drapery, and the head on the neck all suggest that it would be better placed here. The figure on the reverse is much repainted, but it also looks nearer to this painter than to his colleague. PAdd, no. A 219.
