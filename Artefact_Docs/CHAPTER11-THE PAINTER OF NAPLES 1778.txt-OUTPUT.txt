PP-11-*1 - THE PAINTER OF NAPLES 1778 *1 Melbourne, Graham Geddes coll. P 5:2. Ht. 19-3, diam. 27/21. PLATE 166

p. 34, no. 54, ill. on pp. 35-6.
The vase has the form of a lekanis, with figured decoration around the lid and a frontal
white female head on the knob. Internally it is divided into four compartments, around a
central well, and each compartment is fitted with a lid decorated in red-figure, with two small
perforated holes at the top. A comparable r.f. vase is B.M. F 139 [CVA 2, IV Ea, pi. 4,11; LCS,
p. 211, no. 64 and Suppl. Ill, p. 105, no. 105, where it is attributed to the Revel Painter), and
another, in the Gnathia technique, is B.M. F 502 [CVA 1, IV Dc, pi. 8,15-16), although the
former lacks a covering lid, and the latter individual lids to the four compartments. A n earlier
example of a Paestan vase divided internally into compartments, each with a figured lid, will
be found in the remarkable hydria at present on the London market (no. 2/85; PI. 37); a
somewhat later lepaste (no. 165), also in the Geddes collection, is divided internally into four
compartments, like the present vase, which m a y well have served as its model, although there
are no individual lids for the compartments.
Lid: Young satyr in front of seated draped woman, young silen capering by nude w o m an

behind him, standing draped woman, nude w o m a n at laver beside which is a swan.
Knob: Frontal female head, with face in added white, now largely worn off.
Interior: (i) w o m a n seated on dotted rock, veined palmette leaf to r.; (ii) nude youth
bending forward in front of altar; (iii) as for (i) with leaf to 1.; (iv) as for (ii) though the youth
is here not so close to the altar.
