Female head to 1. White palmette-scroll on either side (cf. no. 531).
The two following cups, which are connected in style, stand a little apart from
the above, although the border of the tondo on no. 539 is similar to that on no. 535.
The rendering of the upper part of the bunch of hair on the head on no. 539
corresponds closely with that on no. 482. Both cups have black exteriors, with wave pattern
on a reserved band at the top.

The heads on the following vases look to be connected with those on nos.
539-40. Paestum 1736 (no. 543) and the neck-amphora (no. 542) are known to me
only from the reproductions in the article by Sestieri, and I was not successful in
tracking either of them down, but from the illustrations they might well find a place
in this context.

PAdd, no. A. 207.
Female head to 1. with white flesh.
In PAdd, this, like the previous vase, was also placed in the Group ofNaples 1778, but the
head is very close to those on the lid of the Judgment of Paris labes gamikos no 450 (PI. 216 c)
and must belong to the Group ofNaples 2585 (cf. also the treatment of the hair).

Atti XP CStMG 1971, pi. 111,1.
Frontal female head in added white, below the mouth.
The head is probably to be associated with the work of this painter, but its condition
makes a more positive attribution difficult.
